# UI and API Automation Testing Project

## Overview

This project automates UI and API testing for Upwork and the Noctua Sky website respectively, using Python. Selenium is utilized for UI automation, including grid testing with Selenium Server, while API testing for Noctua Sky is conducted using the `requests` library. The tests follow the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for better organization and maintainability.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Selenium WebDriver
- Selenium Grid
- `requests` Library

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several directories to organize the code effectively:

- **infra**: Contains any infrastructure-related code
- **logic**: Consists of the core logic of the application, including utilities, helpers, and any additional logic required for testing.
- **tests**: Houses the test scripts responsible for sending requests to API endpoints and validating the responses.



## Running Tests

Ensure you have Python installed on your system and install the necessary dependencies, including the `requests` library. Configure any parameters required for testing, such as base URL or authentication tokens, in the `infra` directory.

To run the tests, navigate to the `tests` directory and execute the test script(s) using Python. Review the test results to ensure the API endpoints are functioning correctly and meeting the specified criteria.
